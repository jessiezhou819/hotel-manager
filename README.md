# Hotel Management System

![](https://github.com/jessiezhou819/hotel-manager/blob/main/hotelManagerDemo.gif)

The application serves as a *hotel management system* that provides a 
simple yet efficient user interface for users to keep track of guest 
information during check-in and check-out. A registration list will be
provided that gives a summary of current guests.The **main users** of this 
app would be hotel front desk staff and administrators. By collecting
personal profiles including contact info, room type, and extra 
charges to the customer, the hotel can be managed in an organized manner.

This project is of interest to me because I have always enjoyed travelling
and I noticed that having a well-designed management system in a hotel
can greatly increase one's staying experience. This inspires me to develop 
a similar real-world application to investigate how the system
actually works. Also, since the scale of this project can be fairly flexible, 
I am allowed to gradually add more features to this application as I 
gain experiences.
